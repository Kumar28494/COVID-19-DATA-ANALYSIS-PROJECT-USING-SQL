# 🚀 Excited to share my recent #DataAnalysis project on COVID-19 using #SQL and #PostgreSQL! 📊🦠

In this project, we dove deep into the COVID-19 dataset, analyzing critical metrics with two main tables: coviddeaths and covidvaccinations.
Here are some key insights we uncovered:

## 🌍 Global Insights:

### 📅 Date-wise death tolls across the world.
### 🌎 Total COVID-19 cases and deaths globally.
### 📈 Percentage of deaths relative to the entire population.
### 🏅 Countries with the highest death counts.
## 🇮🇳 India Focus:

## 🇮🇳 Date-wise death tolls in India.
### 📊 Total COVID-19 cases and deaths in India.
### 🧮 Percentage of positive cases in India.
## 🌐 Regional Breakdown:

## 🌍 Continent-wise total cases and deaths.
### 📆 Daily new cases worldwide.
### 💉 Total number of vaccinated individuals.
This project showcases the power of SQL for extracting and analyzing complex datasets, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's impact on a global and local scale.
